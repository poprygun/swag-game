# Randomize

## Overview 

Demonstrates functionality of the `client` microservice that uses API contract implemented
by Randomizer product employing Feign.  

**io.pivotal.microsamples.api.GuessApiImpl** implements generated REST API endpoint that calls
Randomizer API using randomizer-client library that includes stubs required to perform Feign call.

Generation of Server Stub code is initiated in pom.xml using [swagger-codegen-maven-plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen-maven-plugin)
and configured in config/api-definitions.yml

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

### Compile and start server

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Make sure application is running

```shell
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8082/v2/guess'
```

### Make remote call to Randomizer Server and Return some data

```shell
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://localhost:8082/v2/guess/allGuesses'
```
